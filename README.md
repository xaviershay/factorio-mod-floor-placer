# Floor Placer

Place floor and landfill ghosts by dragging a selection.

## Compatibility

It should "just work" with mods that add other blueprintable tiles, such as Space Exploration.

## TODO

* More use in anger.
* Integrate with undo/redo.
* Make an icon.
* Space Exploration platform ghosts can be placed on planets, which doesn't match behaviour if
  placing from inventory. Just a style thing though, the placement will fail
  when a bot tries to construct it.
